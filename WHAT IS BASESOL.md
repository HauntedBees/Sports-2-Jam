# BaseSol - The Milky Way Sport 2
There's nothing humans love more on a casual Sunnday evening than heading to the local planetarium, buying some hot dogs or American Sludge, and looking up at the sky to watch a good old fashioned game of BaseSol. Since the **Global BaseSol League** was formed in 2876AD (or 807NC), they have worked with the best BaseSol players around the world to compete for an international audience during BaseSol season. Combining humankind's love of stargazing and competition, BaseSol was one of the first Sports 2 to capture the hearts of those curious about the limitations of Astral Projection - or lack thereof!

## The "Video" Game
Thanks to cybercomputer webterface technology, the "video" game publisher **digital artisinal**'s new division **da Sports 2** is faithfully recreating the world's favorite Sports 2 in "video" game form, so that fans can enjoy the timeless gameplay of classic Sports 2 like **BaseSol**, **Nudelkampf**, and **Deep Sea Football** in the comfort of their own homes, without needing to worry about finding teammates or Astrally Projecting themselves. Players need only "project" themselves into their favorite couch, turn on their infoscreens, and play **da Sports 2** "video" games on their favorite radio players like the **Videostation**, **Turbo Drive**, **MegaGrafx-17**, or **iGame™®©**.

## How to Play
Much like many of the historical "sports" that preceded Sports 2, a standard BaseSol game consists of two **teams** competing to earn **points**, with the **team** with the most **points** at the end of the game being declared the winner.

### Summary
The tildir* of a standard **BaseSol** game is as follows:
 1. The **stopping team**'s **pitcher** projects the **sol** towards the **jumping team**'s **becomer.**
 2. The **becomer** *strikes* the **sol** and is fused with it, then launched into the playing field. If they miss the **sol** twice they are *struck out.*
 3. The **becomer**'s goal is to *jump off* the **sol** at the right moment and land on one of the **stars** on the playing field to become *safe.* At the end of a **round**, the number of players from the **jumping team** that are *safe*ly on **stars** will be the number of **points** that **team** gets.
 4. The **stopping team**'s job is to get the **becomer** *out*. This **team** will have **wanderers** scattered across the field and **catchers** at each **star**, all of whom can catch and throw the **sol** to each other. There are many ways they can get the **becomer** *out*:
    1. Any **wanderer** or **catcher** who catches the **sol** while the **becomer** is still fused with it will instantly get them *out*.
    2. If the **becomer** lands on a **star** that is guarded by a **catcher** who is holding the **sol**, they will become out.
    3. Any **catcher** holding the **sol** can perform a *slam*, which will launch several **slammers** outwards from them. If any of these **slammers** hit the **becomer**, they will be *slam dunked* and taken *out*. The **pitcher** can also perform a much more powerful *slam* that will emit **homing slammers** that will target the **becomer**.
 5. After the **jumping team** has had three players taken *out*, the **stopping team** and **jumping team** will switch and repeat. After that **team** also gets three players **out**, the **inning** will end, and the next **inning** will begin. After **three innings**, the game will end and the winner will be declared.

\* From the AD English acronym **tl;dr**. Means "a short summary of a longer work."

### Full Rules
A BaseSol game consists of **three innings**; each **inning** consists of two **rounds**, so that each **team** may alternate between **jumping** and **stopping** in every **inning**. Which **team** *jumps* first is determined by a coin toss at the start of the game; after the coin toss is determined, the winning **team** will **jump** first in each **inning**.

At the start of each **round**, the **stopping team** will choose a **constellation** to be the playing field for that **round**. Each **team** can choose from 3 different **constellations**, with different numbers of **stars** in them. **Constellations** with more **stars** will have more **catchers** but fewer **wanderers**, and vice versa. The **constellation** should be chosen strategically to match the **stopping team**'s strengths and the **jumping team**'s weaknesses.

One player is chosen as the **pitcher** on the **stopping team**, and one player on the **jumping team** is chosen as the **becomer.** The **pitcher** will project the **sol** to the **becomer**, who will *strike it* with their hands and fuse with the **sol** and both will be launched into the **constellation** on the playing field. If the **becomer** misses the **sol**, they will be *struck in* and get to try again. If they miss a second time, they will be *struck out*.

Once the **sol** and **becomer** are on the field, each **team** has different priorities.

The **becomer**'s goal is to *jump off* the **sol** and reach a **star** that is not currently occupied by one of their **teammates**. The basic strategy for the **becomer** is to hit the **sol** so that it flies right past an unoccupied **star**, so they can *jump off* when the **sol** is closest to the **star** and quickly run to it. However, caution must be taken to not hit the **sol** *too* close, or else the **catcher** on the **star** might grab it before the **becomer** can reach it, and they will be taken *out.*

While the **becomer** is on the field, any other players from the **jumping team** that are occupying **stars** may choose to run to any other **star** on the field. This might be done to clear up some **stars** that are easier for the other players on their **team** to reach when they are **becomers**. However, any players not occupying a **star** if and when the **becomer** is taken *out* will also be taken *out* in the process. Additionally, any players running between **stars** can be taken *out* in any of the ways the **becomer** can be taken out.

The **stopping team** has **wanderers** and **catchers** on the field; their goal is to knock any players from the **jumping team** *out*. Both can *catch* and *throw* the **sol** to any other **wanderer** or **catcher** on the field, including the **pitcher**.

**Wanderers** can freely move around the field, whereas **catchers** remain fixed to **stars**. **Catchers** can also perform *slams*, which will launch several **slammers** from their centers. These **slammers** will fly outward for a short time before fading away. The **pitcher** is special in that they can move around the field like a **wanderer** but can also perform a **slam** like **catchers**. The **pitcher's slam** is unique in that its **slammers** will not fade away, and they will actively target the **becomer**.

There are three ways for the **stopping team** to take the **becomer** (or any other player from the **jumping team**) out:
 1. Catching the **sol** while the **becomer** is still fused with it.
 2. (**Catchers** only) Holding the **sol** at a **star** when the **becomer** reaches that **star**.
 3. Hitting the **becomer** with one or more **slammers**.

Additionally, if the **pitcher** or a **catcher** that a **jumping team** player is on catches the **sol**, and all of the **jumping team** players on the field are currently on **stars**, they will be declared safe and no more movement between stars may happen.

After a **becomer** lands safely on a **star** or is taken *out*, another player from the **jumping team** will be the next **becomer** and the process will repeat; with the **pitcher** projecting the **sol** to them. If every **star** becomes occupied by players from the **jumping team**, that **team** will earn a **touchdown**: all players from the **jumping team** will leave their **stars** and the **team** will receive one point for every **star** in the **constellation**, then the game will continue. Once three players from the **jumping team** have been taken *out*, that **team** will be awarded **points** based on how many players they have on the field, then the two **teams** will switch places and the second **round** of the **inning** will begin. Once both **rounds** have been completed, the next **inning** will start. After **three innings** the game will end, and the **team** with the most **points** will be declared the winner.
